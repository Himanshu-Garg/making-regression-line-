# Making Regression line

We are using 80% of the data (H-Index and Impact Factor of the journals) to determine its regression line and the finding mean squared error on rest 20% of the data. 

here, I have cleaned the data myself downloaded from different sites and used it to determine the regression line.

my problem that I face here is that both H-Index and Impact Factor is not available on same site; so I have to download it from different sites and merge it.
